## Kilohertz project<br />Site: Bergen, Norway<br/>Scheduled uptime: 24 NOV 2016 - 26 NOV 2016 (inclusive)

This is the official repository of the Bergen-based Kilohertz site, which is an antenna structure tuned into Norwegian and NATO military radio frequency bands. The receiver in the antenna structure will constantly update this repository with the latest power sweeps of the radio frequency spectrum as can be received in the city. A new update will be pushed into this repository approximately every 4.5 hours.

The Bergen antenna is part of a bigger network-in-progress, Kilohertz, which is a participatory research project about the current state of use of the radio frequency spectrum for military purposes. Goal of this long-term project is to create site-specific DIY antennas in rural (or almost rural) that are tuned in to local military radio communication channels with the attempt to intercept and store evidence of military usages in the RF spectreum and to make them comparable with other places in the world. The project is the first project aiming to create a comprehensive library of military RF usage evidence.
